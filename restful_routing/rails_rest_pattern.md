# Rails REST Pattern

The Rails implementation of the REST pattern defines five essential actions:

**Listing** resources accomplished with `index`<br>
**Displaying** a single resource accomplished with `show`<br>
**Deleting** a single resource accomplished with `destroy`<br>
**Creating** a new resource accomplished with `new` and `create`<br>
**Changing** a single resource accomplished with `edit` and `update`

##CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- the actions that we perform.
- In Rails, REST and CRUD are best friends.
